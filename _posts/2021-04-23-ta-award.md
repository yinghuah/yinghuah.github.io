  I was a Teaching Assistant for the course "VLSI System Design" (EE 577a) in Spring 2020. Today, I am glad to receive the Honorable Mention of the Charles L. Weber Memorial Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award at the ECE Department of the University of Southern California. I want to thank all my students in this course, and your recognition is the best gift I get in teaching.
