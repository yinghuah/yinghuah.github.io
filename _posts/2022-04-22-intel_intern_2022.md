  I am excited to announce that I have accepted an offer from Intel Corporation as a Security Research Intern at the Client Computing Group (CCG). A huge thanks to my hiring manager Chirag Shah and soon-to-be colleagues Rosario J D'Souza, Amir Khatib Zadeh, and KK Yu who interviewed me and provided me with valuable feedback on my PhD research in hardware security & trust. Thanks to Lisa Munger and Paula Valverde who assisted me a lot in making the recruiting process so smooth. As always, I deeply appreciate my professors Pierluigi Nuzzo and Peter Beerel for all the support and guidance.
