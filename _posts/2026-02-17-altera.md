I’m excited to share that I’ve joined Altera as a Staff Machine Learning Engineer.
</p>
<p>
Over the past few years at Synopsys, I had the opportunity to work on AI-driven design automation across multiple stages of the silicon lifecycle — from applying ML to complex optimization tasks to building agentic infrastructure that orchestrates multi-step workflows in production environments. It was an incredible experience pushing AI beyond prototypes and into real EDA systems.
</p>
<p>
At Altera, I’m focusing on building and scaling AI capabilities for FPGA products, working at the intersection of machine learning, EDA systems, and hardware platforms. I’m particularly excited about the opportunity to shape next-generation design workflows that are not just incrementally faster, but structurally smarter.
</p>
<p>
Grateful to the teams and mentors at Synopsys who made the journey meaningful — and excited for what’s ahead.
