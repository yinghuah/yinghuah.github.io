  I have passed my Ph.D. dissertation defense, a milestone event in my life! Many thanks to my advisor Prof. Pierluigi Nuzzo and my defense committee members, Prof. Peter Beerel and Prof. Chao Wang, for their constructive feedback on my research. Many thanks to all my collaborators! I couldn't have achieved this without your support!
