<p style="font-size:0.9em;">
  I feel elated to share the news that our paper “TriLock: IC Protection with Tunable Corruptibility and Resilience to SAT and Removal Attacks” has been accepted as a full paper at the Design, Automation, and Test in Europe Conference (DATE 2022), one of the top conferences in the EDA field. I want to thank my co-author Yuke Zhang for her dedicated contribution in the collaboration and our advisors Pierluigi Nuzzo and Peter Beerel for their constant support and help along the way!
