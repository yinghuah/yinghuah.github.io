  Our Work-In-Progress (WIP) paper "Circumventing Machine Learning-Based Attacks to Logic Locking" has been accepted to be presented as a poster in Design Automation Conference (DAC) 2022. Great thanks to my co-authors Subhajit Dutta Chowdhury and Kaixin Yang, our advisor Prof. Pierluigi Nuzzo. More details about this paper/poster to come in the next few weeks!
