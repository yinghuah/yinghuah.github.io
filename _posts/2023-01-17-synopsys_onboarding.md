  I am excited to announce that I have joined Synopsys as a Senior Software Engineer! I interned with the same team in the summer of 2021 and have been inspired by their innovative work and the company culture. As a new member of the team, I look forward to catching up with this vibe and contributing to developing novel EDA solutions for the semiconductor industry. Big thanks to Pranay Prakash, Mark Wilkerson, Prachi Shahi, and the whole team for their warm welcome and help with my smooth transition!
