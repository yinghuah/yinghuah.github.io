I'm excited to announce that our Late Breaking Results paper, "<b>On the One-Key Premise of Logic Locking</b>," has been accepted at <em>DAC, The Chips to Systems Conference 2024</em>.
</p>
<p>
Traditionally, the security of logic locking methods hinges on the assumption that only the correct key can reveal a protected circuit's true functionality. Our research questions this foundational "one-key" premise, introducing a novel attack method. This method is designed to identify multiple, potentially incorrect keys which, when utilized together, can effectively bypass the protection.
</p>
<p>
This attack strategy is organized into a series of independent sub-tasks, making it particularly efficient in a multi-core computing environment. This efficiency is not just theoretical; it presents a tangible threat in scenarios where adversaries have significant computational resources. Our findings demonstrate that this approach can dramatically reduce attack runtime—up to 99.6%—even against logic locking techniques previously considered to be secure.
</p>
<p>
  Immense gratitude is extended to my co-authors, Hari Cherupalli, Mike Borza, and Deepak Sherlekar, at Synopsys Inc., for their invaluable contributions to this work.
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to DAC 2024 happening this June. See you all there!
