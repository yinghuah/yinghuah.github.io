  I'm thrilled to share that our research paper, "DECOR: Enhancing Logic Locking Against Machine Learning-Based Attacks," has been accepted for presentation at the International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ISQED) 2024.
</p>
<p>
  In our work, we present a novel methodology that markedly diminishes structural signatures in logic-locked circuits that are typically exploited by machine learning-based attacks. This universally applicable approach significantly lowers the accuracy of these attacks to near random-guessing levels, enhancing the security of logic locking techniques.

  A special shoutout to my amazing co-authors - my Ph.D. advisor Prof. Pierluigi Nuzzo, and my peers Kaixin Yang and Subhajit Dutta Chowdhury - at USC.
