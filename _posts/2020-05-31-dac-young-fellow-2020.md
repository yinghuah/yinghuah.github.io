  I feel excited to share the news that I have been selected as a Young Fellow at the Design Automation Conference (DAC) 2020. DAC is recognized as the premier conference for design and automation of electronic systems. I look forward to exchanging reserach ideas and progress with others at the upcoming DAC in July!
