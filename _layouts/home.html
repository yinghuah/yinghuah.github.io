<p>
  I am a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://www.altera.com/">Altera</a>, working at the intersection of machine learning, EDA systems, and hardware platforms. My focus is on building and scaling production-ready AI capabilities for FPGA products, with an emphasis on improving performance, productivity, and robustness across real-world silicon design workflows.
</p>
<p>
  Previously at Synopsys, I worked on AI-driven design workflows across multiple stages, applying machine learning to improve optimization and decision-making across diverse design tasks. Building on this foundation, I later focused on prototyping next-generation agentic infrastructure for large-scale design systems, providing orchestration to coordinate execution across tools and agents and enabling end-to-end workflow automation in production environments.
</p>
<p>
  I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California (USC)</a>. I also contribute to the technical community through reviewing and technical service for leading venues in design automation and hardware systems. You may find a list of my publications <a href="/publication/">here</a>.
